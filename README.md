# CookieBlock Browser Extension upgraded to manifest v3 format

[CookieBlock](https://github.com/dibollinger/CookieBlock)  is a browser extension that automatically enforces your GDPR consent preferences for browser cookies. It classifies cookies on-the-fly into four distinct categories, and deletes those that the user did not consent to.

This helps enforce user privacy without having to rely on the website hosting the cookies.

This repository updates the original extension to manifest v3 format.

See original plugin page for instructions and license.
